Version Alpha 1.0 

###Software Requirements

- Autotool
- Maven

###Tested Envirnment

- Unbuntu 14.04
- java version "1.8.0_45" oracle

./configure
make
export SWIFT_JVM_USER_LIB=swift-jvm/swift-jvm-build/target/swift-jvm-build-0.0.1-bin/swift-jvm/classes/ (change this with additional jar folder libraries)
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle/jre/lib/amd64/server (change this with JVM home)
./src/test
```
###Configure Options

- --with-jvm-home, jvm home directory (default:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle)
- --with-swift-jvm-engine-lib, swift jvm engine lib (default: classes)
- --enable-debug=yes, enables the debug verbose

###Test
